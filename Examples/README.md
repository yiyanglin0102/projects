## Graphics Town Example Objects

This is a directory of example objects for Graphics Town.

We don't necessarily expect students to use them, but you can if you want to.
They are more here so the world isn't totally empty.

Credits / Notes:

House - while the design is based on the original (circa 2000) 
    graphics town houses, these are newly created in 2019

    One thing to notice here: I use a single texture for the whole house so it can
    be one mesh.

Track / Cube / Car:
    A simple example of a track (circular) and vehicles that go around it.
    Notice how the track is used by the vehicles to figure out how to move.

    The car is loaded from an FBX file (attribution in that directory).
    But notice how I put the riding point above the car 
    (so you don't have your eyes on the road literally).

Helicopter:
    A simple example in terms of geometry, but a more complex behavior.
    This is adapted (but re-written) from the 2015 assignment.
