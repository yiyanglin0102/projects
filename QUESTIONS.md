## Assignment 11 and 12 Questions

Note: this questions file is designed to help you document what you've done in your assignment. It is important as this is the way we will understand what you have done for grading.

An example `QUESTIONS.md` file is in the `Examples` directory (QUESTIONS-example.md).

## Assignment 11

The rubric has a list of 13 items.

Item 2: List at least 3 distinct behaviors. If you have made more than 3, list up to 5 and choose the ones you think are most interesting. A single sentence describing each one should be sufficient.

2.A: Rainning track
2.B: Airplane track
2.C: Circle train track
2.D: Helicopter track
2.E: Square track

Item 3: Do you have a spline train track? What object should we look at? How do we know it's a spline?

3D Spline track, which is rotating around the entire building.

Item 4: Do you have a train that faces forward on the track and is ridable?

Yes.

Optional Complexity Points: For each one that you've done, give the number (5-13) on the list, describe the behavior, and tell us what object we can see it on. This might take 2-3 sentences per item.

List which other "Behavior Challenges" you completed (from the list of 13 - anything 5 and above). For each, give the number as well as a short (1 sentence is OK) description. And tell us where in the world to see it (what object should we "lookat" and/or "ride"):

(5) 3D Spline track, causing the airplane be able to rotate around the big building.
(7) Forklift is following a square track.
(13) The rainning is what I try to simulate water drop.

## Assignment 12

Object Diversity: List 8 of the different kinds of objects that appear in your world. If you made more than 8 kinds of objects, only list the 8 that are most interesting visually.

O.1 Loaded airplane
O.2 Train
O.3 Volcano
O.4 Fork Lift
O.5 Skyscraper
O.6 Rainning
O.7 House
O.8 Truck

Object Diversity: list one object in your world that is loaded from a model file (e.g., OBJ or FBX). Remember to give proper attribution in your README file, and to include the object in your repository.

Object Diversity: list one of each category
Building: Skyscraper
Natural Element: Rainning
Vehicle (object meant to move): Train

Technical Challenges: For each technical challenge you attempted (from the list of 7), give the number of the challenge, a description of what you did, and a description of the object that it was used on. What objects should we "look at".

(2) Environment map, the entire background
(4) Procedural effects of the ball on circle train track

Pictures: confirm that you placed the required pictures in the Pictures directory.

Consent: do you agree to allow us to use your pictures in future gallery pages? (please answer Yes or No)
No.
